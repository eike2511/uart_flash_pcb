## Hardware:
Gerber and drilling data are in the repository. [Component placement](./uart_flash_pcb_ibom.html)

## Software:
No stand-alone software is needed. Use esptool.py or e.g. VS Code for programming.

## Usage:
1. Connect USB
2. Connect the correct jumpers for 5V or 3.3V
3. Connect the jumpers for auto-flash and auto-RST or use the button
4. Connect the device to be flashed or plug in an ESP-01
5. be save the TXD and RXD are crossed
